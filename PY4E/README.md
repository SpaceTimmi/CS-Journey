# Python for Everybody
Link to [PY4E](https://www.py4e.com)

PY4E is a very good introductory course that I wholeheartedly recommend. As someone with prior coding experience, I found it to be relatively easy, but I can see how some of the later concepts might be challenging for newer learners. Despite this, the course is still worth taking, especially for beginners.

The course does an excellent job of covering the basics of Python and its data structures, which is crucial for building a strong foundation in programming. It also introduces learners to the world of regular expressions, web data retrieval, and interacting with databases using Python. While these topics may present some difficulty, they are essential skills for any aspiring programmer.

Although the coverage of some concepts might be brief, PY4E provides an invaluable starting point for someone interested in learning Computer Science. The knowledge gained from this course acts as a springboard, enabling students to dive into other courses with a better understanding of how programming works at a fundamental level.

In conclusion, PY4E is a worthwhile course that prepares beginners for their programming journey. It equips them with essential Python skills and knowledge. With determination and supplemental resources, learners can overcome these difficulties and emerge with a strong foundation in Python programming, ready to explore more advanced topics and projects.
