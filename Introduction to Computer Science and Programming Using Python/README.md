I really enjoyed this course. When I originally took the course last year, I had some difficulty, but now I understand the concepts well. It is an improvement over PY4E and covers a lot of ground. Although the problem sets are more complex and call for more coding, it's worthwhile. The completion of the problem sets teaches you a lot. It exposes students to concepts like data abstraction and mutability and covers the fundamental data structures in the Python programming language. It does introduce recursion, which can be a difficult subject for beginners to grasp, but that's okay because HTC: Simple Data (the next course) will do a fantastic job of thoroughly introducing the concept. 

I like the way Object-Oriented Programming is split into different lectures and how they build up on each other.  The OOP lectures each focused on one or two concepts, and everything ties neatly together in the end.  The lectures on understanding programming efficiency had several concepts I didn't entirely understand, but generally it was a helpful segment. Overall, the course was excellent and time well spent.
