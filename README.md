# Documenting my OSSU CS Journey: A Path to Completion 

This will be a detailed report on how I'm going about my OSSU Computer Science journey. I have not been able to study for the past 6 months due the academic workload of my undergraduate studies. I want to restart the journey again, and I aim to leverage this opportunity to write about my experience and share the knowledge I acquire along the way. 

By embarking on this endeavor, I seek both accountablity and a means to create a perrsonal record that I can reflect upon in the future. I will be doing a personal project at the end of every course.
